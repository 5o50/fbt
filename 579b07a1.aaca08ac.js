In general, you can compose your translatable text in either format.  As the following example illustrates, the child of the `<fbt>` tag shows up as the first argument to `fbt` and any attributes show up in the optional third argument parameter.  The `desc` (text description) argument is the exception to this rule because it is a *required* parameter and attribute in `fbt(...)` and `<fbt>` respectively.","source":"@site/../docs/api_intro.md","permalink":"/fbt/docs/api_intro","lastUpdatedBy":"John Watson","lastUpdatedAt":1547673253,"sidebar_label":"Introduction","sidebar":"docs","previous":{"title":"Getting Started with React Native for Android","permalink":"/fbt/docs/getting_started_react_native_android"},"next":{"title":"Parameters and interpolation","permalink":"/fbt/docs/params"}}')}}]);
